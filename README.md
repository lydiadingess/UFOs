# UFOs

## Overview

We focused on creating a dynamic webpage using JavaScript. We built a table to hold the information and used filters to narrow down the table information.

This is how the page is displayed when first visiting the site. You are greated with a header and an introduction paragraph. Below the introduction is a table of information.

We are able to filter the table by using the search options on the side. We can filter our search by date, city, state, country, and shape.

We can broadly search by entering one filter criteria, or narrow down the search by using multiple search criterias.

Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

## Summary

### Drawback

While the new webpage with the new filter option is an improvment there are still a few drawbacks with the desgin. The search criteria is case sensative. Using uppercase letters will not provide an accurate search result. If "Aspen" was the search criteria, no results would display. The user would need to search "aspen" for the results to appear. 

### Improvments
- Having the option of a "date range" would be an improvement. If the user know the estimated date range, it would help to filter results.  

- If there is a "space" added to the end of the search criteria, the search results might be scewed. Having a way for the filter to ignore the blank space would help improve the search results.
